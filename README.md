# Exclusion-Zone SASA

A basic Python script implementing Armstrong's Exclusion-Zone SASA formula.

This program calculates the Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) of molecules, with a correction based on average bond length and atomic radii.

# Example Usage
Please enter your molecule here: H2O
Enter probe radius (e.g., 1.4 for water): 1.4
Please enter the Number of bonds (ionic or covalent) here: 2
